# Building a Web Scrapper using Python

## Description
Using Python to scrape and generate CSV files. There are two parts to this project. 

## Part 1: Stanley Cup Scraper
Stanley Cups are the hottest craze right now. The 40 oz sippy cup racked up $750 million in just one year. I wanted to track the prices of Stanley Cups on Amazon. Using Python, I built a price scraper for Stanley Cups. I utilized the BeautifulSoup library and created a function to automate this process. 

## Part 2: Crypto Scrapper
I wanted to be able to track the prices of the top 15 cryptocurrencies. Lately, the crypto market has been booming. In this project, I learned how to use an API to pull in data and turn that data into a CSV file. This entire process is automated. I then took the data and made some visuals using Seaborn and Matplotlib and Tableau. 

### What I learned
- Set up Jupyter Notebooks in VSCode
- Call an API
- Utilize functions in Python for automation
- BeautifulSoup library
